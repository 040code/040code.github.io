## Stefan van den Oord

I love software development. I'm a generalist and I like learning new things all the time. I particulary enjoy functional programming, because I believe it can reduce the complexity of code. And also extreme programming, including practices like pair programming and test-driven design. I also enjoy teaching others about it, for example at conferences, or using coding dojos.
