## Niek Palm 

I am developing for more than a decade software, mainly based on open source stacks. Currently I am having a full stack focus with my strengths on the backend related services, cloud and continuous delivery. Technologies that me keep busy now a days are: AWS, Terraform, Spring Cloud, React, React Native, Continuous Deliver, Docker, Elastic Search and much more. \n\n But cool technologies are not my only passions. I love to just crab by backpack and go around. Creating some nice meals and exploring the creative area of a cook is one of my favourite hobbies. Drinking a great craft beer is something that I love too. And from time to time the body needs some real exercise so I like to have a run or do a hike.
