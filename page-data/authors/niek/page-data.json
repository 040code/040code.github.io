Currently I am having a full stack focus with my strengths on the backend related services, cloud and continuous delivery. Technologies that me keep busy now a days are: AWS, Terraform, Spring Cloud, React, React Native, Continuous Delivery, Docker, Google Cloud, and much more. </p>\n<p>But cool technologies are not my only passions. I love to just crab by backpack and go around. Creating some nice meals and exploring the creative area of a cook is one of my favourite hobbies. Drinking a great craft beer is something that I love too. And from time to time the body needs some real exercise so I like to have a run or do a hike.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":null,"title":"Niek Palm","slug":"niek","github":"npalm","twitter":"niekos77","linkedin":"niekpalm","email":"dev.npalm@gmail.com","avatar":{"publicURL":"/static/niek-1957b0fea78bceb18c3bb9c3e32c55f0.jpg"},"cover":{"publicURL":"/static/noodle_niek-793ac5a581997290cedafd86d6d228e5.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"author":"niek"}}}
